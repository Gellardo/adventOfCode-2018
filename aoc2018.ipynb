    "The first try of just using 3 nested for-loop got really slow after size 25. So I remembered the lectures about dynamic programming and added caching of already computed results. A square of size 30x30 can be computed by adding the values of the 4 inner 15x15 squares. As a final speedup for squares with a prime square-size `n`, I deconstructed a side into `2*n/2 + 1`. This means I can reuse the sizes from `n/2` and only have to sum a small number of energy levels for the edges with the maximum `x` and `y`."
